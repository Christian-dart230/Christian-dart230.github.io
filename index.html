    <p> There once was a boy who wanted it all. <br>
    Power that reaches above the mountains so tall.<br>
    By using his family's enchanted well.<br>
    He will all was reside creating new spells.<br>
    Instead of getting supreme infinte power.<br>
    He actually created a creature that maks the deom quake and cower.<br>
    The creature the boy as a vessel for his cause<br>
    To create a better world that he'll tear with his claws <br>
    Before he was sealed in cauldren so black. <br>
    He pledeged a oath that one day he will come back.<br></p>
